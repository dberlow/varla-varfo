The biggest key on the keyboard is the space key. Typography starts there and its parent space, the “imaginary” em square.

## Square one.

This is a rectangle of equal sides and angles, making it a square.

In type, this square represents to the type designer two things that are important links to the reader. 1. Vertically, the space represents where the vertical intersection is between lines of text when the font is composed at any size, without additional vertical space.

And so the type designer plans the vertical metrics of all the characters of a typeface, based on how the designer wants collections of characters, words usually, to be glimpsed, seen, viewed, skimmed, read, or read for a long time.

Horizontally, the square is the same except when the script and design are proportionally spaced. In such fonts, the horizontal dimension represents default spacing of character as they space best with all the other characters in the font.

(So far, this is true of all scripts, and all designs)


Add direction of reading, at the behest of whichever direction, or directions, a language allows, and the square has direction. For example, and to zero in on one language at a time, all the types of Latin are designed for all the languages that use Latin, to be read in lines from top to bottom, with each line being read from left to right. So the square has a beginning on the top and left sides, and has ends at the bottom and the right side.

The em square (called an em quad in metal type), can be seen typographically as a space with beginnings and ends, and nothing in the midst of that, at the size of the type with no additional spacing around it. The other spaces affecting the appearance of our square, if between the lines is not zero, and/or between the letters isn’t zero.

Between the lines is called line spacing, and is valued either by the size of the space or as a percentage of the size of the type. Between the letters are default letter spacing and kerning, with tracking being a function for changes to both, also usually expressed as a percentage of size.

## Word Space

The largest key on most keyboards and the most important character to spacing in a font is the space, or word space. In Latin use, it’s width is derived from a formula, or simply chosen visually by the type designer. It is often adjusted by applications, but it’s fundamental job is to make certain it’s the largest horizontal space in any given piece of text of a single size.

And it’s second most critical task is to remain around the same as or smaller than the line space, i.e. the space between lines. Obviously the word space is less important and sometimes absent entirely from type that’s glimpsed, seen, or viewed, and is increasingly important as the text is to be skimmed, read, or read for a long time.

The type designer’s task, then, is to create a default word space, and default letter spacing that work. And then the often long and arduous task of making Kerning pairs, creating list of exceptions to the default letter spacing that need to be prevented from touching, like /f/?, which we’ll get to later, or competing with the size of the word space, like /T/o, which we’ve gotten through now.

There’s only one other kind of space left in type and it’s inside the letters. This may be fully enclosed, like /o’s interior, trapped along the baseline and cap height, like /K, or swirling amidst the stem of the /S, but it’s what gives a typeface the start on all the other spaces we’ve covered.

The user has three kinds of control over this space. Type size, applied to a single style of type, makes them grow and shrink linearly(?) to the change of size. Changing to the use of different styles within a regular font family alters the internal white spaces according to the style change from one to the next. Variation font technology, which can provide both of the above, can also provide optical sizes that adjust the internal white spaces over a range of sizes, as well as adding fluid ranges of weight and width axes.

And while typefaces overwhelmingly end with well defined spaces, between words, letters and exceptional pairs, and many typeface families include a blizzard of styles, each with unique spacing, the way the font format, composition software, like design applications and web browsers, Latin typography faces challenges to the type user. And where there is a challenge in Latin, there’s likely to be more elsewhere in the world of scripts.
